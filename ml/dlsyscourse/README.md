I know it's not quite proper to put a solution here, on the public internet,
but I'm just too lazy to make a separate private repo.

Hope nobody would find or abuse it.

Contact me if anybody want me to take it down.

## TOC

This directory follows my code convention:

- `commands.sh` for the command I executed.
- `[0-9]-{name}.excalidraw` for some diagram I draw, to visualize important concepts. I am a visual animal.

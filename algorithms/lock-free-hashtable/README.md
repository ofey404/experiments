[Non-blocking algorithm - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#:~:text=A%20lock%2Dfree%20data%20structure,be%20serialized%20to%20stay%20coherent.)

## Implementations

Some golang implementations: [GitHub - dustinxie/lockfree: Golang lock-free Hashmap and List](https://github.com/dustinxie/lockfree)

Better, with generic support: [GitHub - cornelk/hashmap: A Golang lock-free thread-safe HashMap optimized for fastest read access.](https://github.com/cornelk/hashmap)

# Experiments

This repo contains my miscellaneous exploration on new technologies.

## Conventions

The code talks - anything except the runnable, would stale quickly.

So each subdirectory is self-contained to be reproducible.

Check those files:

1. `README.md` is a minimum description of the contexts.
2. `commands.sh` contains all commands to reproduce the results.

## Special Thanks

# versioned migration

> Unlike Automatic Migrations, the Version Migrations approach uses Atlas to
> automatically generate a set of migration files containing the necessary SQL
> statements to migrate the database. These files can be edited to meet specific
> needs and applied using existing migration tools like Atlas, golang-migrate,
> Flyway, and Liquibase. The API for this approach involves two primary steps.

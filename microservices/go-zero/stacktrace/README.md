# stacktrace

In this repo, I try to master the stacktrace and logging feature based on go-zero.

## simple

It shows how `errors.Wrap` and `logx` package works.

## full-service

This example is to solve multiple problems inter tangled together (Chinese):

1. 访问和 error 日志是两条。
2. 日志需要集成 trace ID
3. 日志需要打 KV，stack、traceID、error content 希望能分开

The log-tracing problem is an architecture level problem,
so I make this POC to show how to solve it.

## 1. Can we dump custom field to HTTP Log?

The answer is no.

It's burned into the builtin middleware, unless we want to recreate the whole logging middleware.

```go
package rest
// rest/engine.go
func (ng *engine) buildChainWithNativeMiddlewares() {}
```

## 2. Trace ID

(1), place internal state like userid in the same log, is a method rather than a goal.

What we want to achieve is to trace all log generated by the same request, and filter out all the noise.

The trace ID seems to be fit.

How to make use of it?
